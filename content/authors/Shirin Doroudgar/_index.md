Shirin Doroudgar, PhD is Assistant Professor of [Internal Medicine](https://phoenixmed.arizona.edu/medicine) at [The University of Arizona College of Medicine – Phoenix](https://phoenixmed.arizona.edu/) and the [Translational Cardiovascular Research Center (TCRC)](https://phoenixmed.arizona.edu/tcrc). Her research program utilizes integrative approaches from molecular and organellar to cellular and organismal levels to examine the dynamics of the protein homeostasis network in health and disease. The Doroudgar Lab’s current focus is on studies of cellular stress responses that underlie the dynamic remodeling of the cardiac myocyte proteome and secretome.

Our studies utilize integrative approaches from molecular and organellar to cellular and organismal levels to examine the dynamics of the protein homeostasis network in health and disease. Since protein homeostasis is a critical determinant of cell and organism health, our research focuses on identifying key molecular regulators of protein homeostasis. Our long-term goal is to better understand the age- and disease-linked changes in protein homeostasis that contribute to heart disease, and to use this understanding to identify proteins that could serve as viable candidates as new therapeutic targets. Currently, our research is primarily related to cardiac pathology, but our work has potential applications in other areas, including cancer biology, neurobiology, and regenerative medicine.
