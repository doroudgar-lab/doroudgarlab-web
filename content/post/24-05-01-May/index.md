Exciting News: Our NIH R01 Grant Has Been Funded!

We are thrilled to announce that our R01 grant, "Post-Transcriptional Regulation of Gene Expression by Ribosome-Binding Protein 1," has been officially funded as of May 2024! This funding will support our research into the critical mechanisms of gene regulation and their implications for cellular function and disease.

A huge congratulations to everyone in the Doroudgar Lab for their hard work and dedication in making this possible. We look forward to advancing our research and sharing new discoveries!
