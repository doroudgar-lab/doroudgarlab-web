abstract: Intercellular communication depends on many factors, including proteins
  released via the classical or non-classical secretory pathways, many of which must
  be properly folded to be functional. Owing to their adverse effects on the secretion
  machinery, stresses such as ischemia can impair the folding of secreted proteins.
  Paradoxically, cells rely on secreted proteins to mount a response designed to resist
  stress-induced damage. This review examines this paradox using proteins secreted
  from the heart, cardiokines, as examples, and focuses on how the ischemic heart
  maintains or even increases the release of select cardiokines that regulate important
  cellular processes in the heart, including excitation-contraction coupling, hypertrophic
  growth, myocardial remodeling and stem cell function, in ways that moderate ischemic
  damage and enhance cardiac repair.
