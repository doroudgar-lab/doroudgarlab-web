 abstract = {Secreted and membrane proteins play critical roles in myocardial
health and disease. Studies in non-myocytes have shown that the
peri-nuclear ER is the site for synthesis, folding, and quality
control of most secreted and membrane proteins, as well as a
nexus of a signal transduction system, called the ER stress
response, which informs the cell about the status of ER protein
folding. Moreover, the dynamic physical and functional
association of the ER with mitochondria is a key site
responsible for integrating ER function and mitochondrial
metabolism, but is only just beginning to be understood in the
myocardium. Although a great deal is known about roles played by
the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) in contractile calcium handling
in the heart, little is known about the relative locations and
functions of the peri-nuclear ER and the SR in terms of secreted
and membrane protein synthesis and folding. In this review we
will explore the current state of knowledge of the location of
secreted and membrane protein synthesis, folding, and quality
control machinery in cardiac myocytes, as well as our
understanding of the functional consequences of ER stress and
the unfolded protein response in the heart in terms of protein
synthesis, cell growth, and metabolic regulation. This article
is part of a Special Issue entitled ``Focus on Cardiac
Metabolism''.},
