 abstract = {RATIONALE: Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress dysregulates ER
proteostasis, which activates the transcription factor, ATF6
(activating transcription factor 6$α$), an inducer of genes
that enhance protein folding and restore ER proteostasis.
Because of increased protein synthesis, it is possible that
protein folding and ER proteostasis are challenged during
cardiac myocyte growth. However, it is not known whether ATF6 is
activated, and if so, what its function is during hypertrophic
growth of cardiac myocytes. OBJECTIVE: To examine the activity
and function of ATF6 during cardiac hypertrophy. METHODS AND
RESULTS: We found that ER stress and ATF6 were activated and
ATF6 target genes were induced in mice subjected to an acute
model of transverse aortic constriction, or to free-wheel
exercise, both of which promote adaptive cardiac myocyte
hypertrophy with preserved cardiac function. Cardiac
myocyte-specific deletion of Atf6 (ATF6 cKO [conditional
knockout]) blunted transverse aortic constriction and
exercise-induced cardiac myocyte hypertrophy and impaired
cardiac function, demonstrating a role for ATF6 in compensatory
myocyte growth. Transcript profiling and chromatin
immunoprecipitation identified RHEB (Ras homologue enriched in
brain) as an ATF6 target gene in the heart. RHEB is an activator
of mTORC1 (mammalian/mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1),
a major inducer of protein synthesis and subsequent cell growth.
Both transverse aortic constriction and exercise upregulated
RHEB, activated mTORC1, and induced cardiac hypertrophy in wild
type mouse hearts but not in ATF6 cKO hearts. Mechanistically,
knockdown of ATF6 in neonatal rat ventricular myocytes blocked
phenylephrine- and IGF1 (insulin-like growth factor 1)-mediated
RHEB induction, mTORC1 activation, and myocyte growth, all of
which were restored by ectopic RHEB expression. Moreover,
adeno-associated virus 9- RHEB restored cardiac growth to ATF6
cKO mice subjected to transverse aortic constriction. Finally,
ATF6 induced RHEB in response to growth factors, but not in
response to other activators of ATF6 that do not induce growth,
indicating that ATF6 target gene induction is stress specific.
CONCLUSIONS: Compensatory cardiac hypertrophy activates ER
stress and ATF6, which induces RHEB and activates mTORC1. Thus,
ATF6 is a previously unrecognized link between growth stimuli
and mTORC1-mediated cardiac growth.},
