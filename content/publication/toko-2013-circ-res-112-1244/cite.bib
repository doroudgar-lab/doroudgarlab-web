 abstract = {RATIONALE: Cardiac hypertrophy results from the complex
interplay of differentially regulated cascades based on the
phosphorylation status of involved signaling molecules. Although
numerous critical regulatory kinases and phosphatases have been
identified in the myocardium, the intracellular mechanism for
temporal regulation of signaling duration and intensity remains
obscure. In the nonmyocyte context, control of folding,
activity, and stability of proteins is mediated by the prolyl
isomerase Pin1, but the role of Pin1 in the heart is unknown.
OBJECTIVE: To establish the role of Pin1 in the heart. METHODS
AND RESULTS: Here, we show that either genetic deletion or
cardiac overexpression of Pin1 blunts hypertrophic responses
induced by transaortic constriction and consequent cardiac
failure in vivo. Mechanistically, we find that Pin1 directly
binds to Akt, mitogen activated protein kinase (MEK), and Raf-1
in cultured cardiomyocytes after hypertrophic stimulation.
Furthermore, loss of Pin1 leads to diminished hypertrophic
signaling of Akt and MEK, whereas overexpression of Pin1
increases Raf-1 phosphorylation on the autoinhibitory site
Ser259, leading to reduced MEK activation. CONCLUSIONS:
Collectively, these data support a role for Pin1 as a central
modulator of the intensity and duration of 2 major hypertrophic
signaling pathways, thereby providing a novel target for
regulation and control of cardiac hypertrophy.},
