abstract: Multiple myeloma is a malignant disease, caused by an uncontrolled clonal
  proliferation of a specific group of white blood cells, the plasma cells. Clinical
  manifestations include bone pain due to osteolysis, hypercalcemia, anemia, and renal
  insufficiency. Proteasome inhibitors have substantially improved survival of patients
  suffering from multiple myeloma, providing an efficient treatment option mainly
  for relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma. Although constituting one substance
  class, bortezomib, carfilzomib, and ixazomib differ greatly regarding their non-hematologic
  side effects. This article reviews the clinical and preclinical data on approved
  proteasome inhibitors in an attempt to decipher the underlying pathomechanisms related
  to cardiovascular adverse events seen in clinical trials.
