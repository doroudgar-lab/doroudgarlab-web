abstract: Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress is a result of conditions that imbalance
  protein homeostasis or proteostasis at the ER, for example ischemia, and is a common
  event in various human pathologies, including the diseased heart. Cardiac integrity
  and function depend on the active secretion of mature proteins from a variety of
  cell types in the heart, a process that requires an intact ER environment for efficient
  protein folding and trafficking to the secretory pathway. As a consequence of ER
  stress, most protein secretion by the ER secretory pathway is decreased. Strikingly,
  there is a select group of proteins that are secreted in greater quantities during
  ER stress. ER stress resulting from the dysregulation of ER Ca2+ levels, for instance,
  stimulates the secretion of Ca2+-binding ER chaperones, especially GRP78, GRP94,
  calreticulin, and mesencephalic astrocyte-derived neurotrophic factor (MANF), which
  play a multitude of roles outside the cell, strongly depending on the cell type
  and tissue. Here we review current insights in ER stress-induced secretion of proteins,
  particularly from the heart, and highlight the extracellular functions of these
  proteins, ranging from the augmentation of cardiac cell viability to the modulation
  of pro- and anti-apoptotic, oncogenic, and immune-stimulatory cell signaling, cell
  invasion, extracellular proteostasis, and more. Many of the roles of ER stress-induced
  protein secretion remain to be explored in the heart. This article is part of a
  special issue entitled ``The Role of Proteostasis Derailment in Cardiac Diseases.''
