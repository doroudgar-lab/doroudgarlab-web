abstract: 'Background: S100A4 has recently emerged as an important player in cardiac
  disease, affecting phenotype development in animal models of myocardial infarction
  and pathological cardiac hypertrophy, albeit it is unclear whether S100A4 exerts
  a detrimental or beneficial function. The goal of the current study was to analyze
  S100A4 expression in models of cardiac pathology, investigate its degradation by
  the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS), and furthermore examine the functional effects
  of S100A4 levels in a 3D model of engineered heart tissue (EHT). Methods and Results:
  S100A4 mRNA and protein levels were analyzed in different models of cardiac pathology
  via quantitative RT-PCR and Western blot, showing a higher S100A4 steady-state protein
  concentration in hearts of Mybpc3-knock-in (KI) hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM)
  mice. COS-7 cells co-transfected with plasmids encoding mutant (MUT) Asb2$β$ lacking
  the E3 ligase activity in combination with V5-tagged S100A4 plasmid presented higher
  S100A4-V5 protein steady-state concentrations than cells co-transfected with the
  Asb2$β$ wild type (WT) plasmid. This effect was blunted by treatment with the specific
  proteasome inhibitor epoxomicin. Adeno-associated virus serotype 6 (AAV6)-mediated
  S100A4 overexpression in a 3D model of EHT did not affect contractile parameters.
  Immunofluorescence analysis showed a cytosolic and partly nuclear expression pattern
  of S100A4. Gene expression analysis in EHTs overexpressing S100A4-V5 showed markedly
  lower steady-state concentrations of genes involved in cardiac fibrosis and pathological
  cardiac hypertrophy. Conclusion: We showed that S100A4 protein level is higher in
  cardiac tissue of Mybpc3-KI HCM mice probably as a result of a lower degradation
  by the E3 ligase Asb2$β$. While an overexpression of S100A4 did not alter contractile
  parameters in EHTs, downstream gene expression analysis points toward modulation
  of signaling cascades involved in fibrosis and hypertrophy.'
