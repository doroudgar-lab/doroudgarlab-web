 abstract = {Stresses that perturb the folding of nascent endoplasmic
reticulum (ER) proteins activate the ER stress response. Upon ER
stress, ER-associated ATF6 is cleaved; the resulting active
cytosolic fragment of ATF6 translocates to the nucleus, binds to
ER stress response elements (ERSEs), and induces genes,
including the ER-targeted chaperone, GRP78. Recent studies
showed that nutrient and oxygen starvation during tissue
ischemia induce certain ER stress response genes, including
GRP78; however, the role of ATF6 in mediating this induction has
not been examined. In the current study, simulating ischemia
(sI) in a primary cardiac myocyte model system caused a
reduction in the level of ER-associated ATF6 with a coordinate
increase of ATF6 in nuclear fractions. An ERSE in the GRP78 gene
not previously shown to be required for induction by other ER
stresses was found to bind ATF6 and to be critical for maximal
ischemia-mediated GRP78 promoter induction. Activation of ATF6
and the GRP78 promoter, as well as grp78 mRNA accumulation
during sI, were reversed upon simulated reperfusion (sI/R).
Moreover, dominant-negative ATF6, or ATF6-targeted miRNA blocked
sI-mediated grp78 induction, and the latter increased cardiac
myocyte death upon simulated reperfusion, demonstrating critical
roles for endogenous ATF6 in ischemia-mediated ER stress
activation and cell survival. This is the first study to show
that ATF6 is activated by ischemia but inactivated upon
reperfusion, suggesting that it may play a role in the induction
of ER stress response genes during ischemia that could have a
preconditioning effect on cell survival during reperfusion.},
