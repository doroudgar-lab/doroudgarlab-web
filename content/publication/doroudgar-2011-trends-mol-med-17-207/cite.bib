 abstract = {Intercellular communication depends on many factors, including
proteins released via the classical or non-classical secretory
pathways, many of which must be properly folded to be
functional. Owing to their adverse effects on the secretion
machinery, stresses such as ischemia can impair the folding of
secreted proteins. Paradoxically, cells rely on secreted
proteins to mount a response designed to resist stress-induced
damage. This review examines this paradox using proteins
secreted from the heart, cardiokines, as examples, and focuses
on how the ischemic heart maintains or even increases the
release of select cardiokines that regulate important cellular
processes in the heart, including excitation-contraction
coupling, hypertrophic growth, myocardial remodeling and stem
cell function, in ways that moderate ischemic damage and enhance
cardiac repair.},
