abstract: 'RATIONALE: Genome editing by CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short
  palindromic repeats)/Cas9 is evolving rapidly. Recently, second-generation CRISPR/Cas9
  activation systems based on nuclease inactive dead (d)Cas9 fused to transcriptional
  transactivation domains were developed for directing specific guide (g)RNAs to regulatory
  regions of any gene of interest, to enhance transcription. The application of dCas9
  to activate cardiomyocyte transcription in targeted genomic loci in vivo has not
  been demonstrated so far. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to develop a mouse model for cardiomyocyte-specific,
  CRISPR-mediated transcriptional modulation, and to demonstrate its versatility by
  targeting Mef2d and Klf15 loci (2 well-characterized genes implicated in cardiac
  hypertrophy and homeostasis) for enhanced transcription. METHODS AND RESULTS: A
  mouse model expressing dCas9 with the VPR transcriptional transactivation domains
  under the control of the Myh (myosin heavy chain) 6 promoter was generated. These
  mice innocuously expressed dCas9 exclusively in cardiomyocytes. For initial proof-of-concept,
  we selected Mef2d, which when overexpressed, led to hypertrophy and heart failure,
  and Klf15, which is lowly expressed in the neonatal heart. The most effective gRNAs
  were first identified in fibroblast (C3H/10T1/2) and myoblast (C2C12) cell lines.
  Using an improved triple gRNA expression system (TRISPR [triple gRNA expression
  construct]), up to 3 different gRNAs were transduced simultaneously to identify
  optimal conditions for transcriptional activation. For in vivo delivery of the validated
  gRNA combinations, we employed systemic administration via adeno-associated virus
  serotype 9. On gRNA delivery targeting Mef2d expression, we recapitulated the anticipated
  cardiac hypertrophy phenotype. Using gRNA targeting Klf15, we could enhance its
  transcription significantly, although Klf15 is physiologically silenced at that
  time point. We further confirmed specific and robust dCas9VPR on-target effects.
  CONCLUSIONS: The developed mouse model permits enhancement of gene expression by
  using endogenous regulatory genomic elements. Proof-of-concept in 2 independent
  genomic loci suggests versatile applications in controlling transcription in cardiomyocytes
  of the postnatal heart.'
