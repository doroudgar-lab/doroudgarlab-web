abstract: Our understanding of the transition from physiological to pathological cardiac
  hypertrophy remains elusive and largely based on reductionist hypotheses. Here,
  we profiled the translatomes of 15 mouse hearts to provide a molecular blueprint
  of altered gene networks in early cardiac remodeling. Using co-expression analysis,
  we showed how sub-networks are orchestrated into functional modules associated with
  pathological phenotypes. We discovered unappreciated hub genes, many undocumented
  for their role in cardiac hypertrophy, and genes in the transcriptional network
  that were rewired in the translational network, and associated with semantically
  different subsets of enriched functional terms, such as Fam210a, a novel musculoskeletal
  modulator, or Psmd12, implicated in protein quality control. Using their correlation
  structure, we found that transcriptome networks are only partially reproducible
  at the translatome level, providing further evidence of post-transcriptional control
  at the level of translation. Our results provide novel insights into the complexity
  of the organization of in vivo cardiac regulatory networks.
