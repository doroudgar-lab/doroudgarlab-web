abstract: Pathological cardiac hypertrophy is an independent risk for heart failure
  (HF) and sudden death. Deciphering signaling pathways regulating intracellular Ca2+
  homeostasis that control adaptive and pathological cardiac growth may enable identification
  of novel therapeutic targets. The objective of the present study is to determine
  the role of the store-operated calcium entry-associated regulatory factor (Saraf),
  encoded by the Tmem66 gene, on cardiac growth control in vitro and in vivo. Saraf
  is a single-pass membrane protein located at the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum and
  regulates intracellular calcium homeostasis. We found that Saraf expression was
  upregulated in the hypertrophied myocardium and was sufficient for cell growth in
  response to neurohumoral stimulation. Increased Saraf expression caused cell growth,
  which was associated with dysregulation of calcium-dependent signaling and sarcoplasmic
  reticulum calcium content. In vivo, Saraf augmented cardiac myocyte growth in response
  to angiotensin II and resulted in increased cardiac remodeling together with worsened
  cardiac function. Mechanistically, Saraf activated mTORC1 (mechanistic target of
  rapamycin complex 1) and increased protein synthesis, while mTORC1 inhibition blunted
  Saraf-dependent cell growth. In contrast, the hearts of Saraf knockout mice and
  Saraf-deficient myocytes did not show any morphological or functional alterations
  after neurohumoral stimulation, but Saraf depletion resulted in worsened cardiac
  function after acute pressure overload. SARAF knockout blunted transverse aortic
  constriction cardiac myocyte hypertrophy and impaired cardiac function, demonstrating
  a role for SARAF in compensatory myocyte growth. Collectively, these results reveal
  a novel link between sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium homeostasis and mTORC1 activation
  that is regulated by Saraf.
