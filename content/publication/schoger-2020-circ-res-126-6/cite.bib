 abstract = {RATIONALE: Genome editing by CRISPR (clustered regularly
interspaced short palindromic repeats)/Cas9 is evolving rapidly.
Recently, second-generation CRISPR/Cas9 activation systems based
on nuclease inactive dead (d)Cas9 fused to transcriptional
transactivation domains were developed for directing specific
guide (g)RNAs to regulatory regions of any gene of interest, to
enhance transcription. The application of dCas9 to activate
cardiomyocyte transcription in targeted genomic loci in vivo has
not been demonstrated so far. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to develop a
mouse model for cardiomyocyte-specific, CRISPR-mediated
transcriptional modulation, and to demonstrate its versatility
by targeting Mef2d and Klf15 loci (2 well-characterized genes
implicated in cardiac hypertrophy and homeostasis) for enhanced
transcription. METHODS AND RESULTS: A mouse model expressing
dCas9 with the VPR transcriptional transactivation domains under
the control of the Myh (myosin heavy chain) 6 promoter was
generated. These mice innocuously expressed dCas9 exclusively in
cardiomyocytes. For initial proof-of-concept, we selected Mef2d,
which when overexpressed, led to hypertrophy and heart failure,
and Klf15, which is lowly expressed in the neonatal heart. The
most effective gRNAs were first identified in fibroblast
(C3H/10T1/2) and myoblast (C2C12) cell lines. Using an improved
triple gRNA expression system (TRISPR [triple gRNA expression
construct]), up to 3 different gRNAs were transduced
simultaneously to identify optimal conditions for
transcriptional activation. For in vivo delivery of the
validated gRNA combinations, we employed systemic administration
via adeno-associated virus serotype 9. On gRNA delivery
targeting Mef2d expression, we recapitulated the anticipated
cardiac hypertrophy phenotype. Using gRNA targeting Klf15, we
could enhance its transcription significantly, although Klf15 is
physiologically silenced at that time point. We further
confirmed specific and robust dCas9VPR on-target effects.
CONCLUSIONS: The developed mouse model permits enhancement of
gene expression by using endogenous regulatory genomic elements.
Proof-of-concept in 2 independent genomic loci suggests
versatile applications in controlling transcription in
cardiomyocytes of the postnatal heart.},
