 abstract = {Our understanding of the transition from physiological to
pathological cardiac hypertrophy remains elusive and largely
based on reductionist hypotheses. Here, we profiled the
translatomes of 15 mouse hearts to provide a molecular blueprint
of altered gene networks in early cardiac remodeling. Using
co-expression analysis, we showed how sub-networks are
orchestrated into functional modules associated with
pathological phenotypes. We discovered unappreciated hub genes,
many undocumented for their role in cardiac hypertrophy, and
genes in the transcriptional network that were rewired in the
translational network, and associated with semantically
different subsets of enriched functional terms, such as Fam210a,
a novel musculoskeletal modulator, or Psmd12, implicated in
protein quality control. Using their correlation structure, we
found that transcriptome networks are only partially
reproducible at the translatome level, providing further
evidence of post-transcriptional control at the level of
translation. Our results provide novel insights into the
complexity of the organization of in vivo cardiac regulatory
networks.},
