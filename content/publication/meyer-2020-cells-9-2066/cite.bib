 abstract = {Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress is a result of conditions that
imbalance protein homeostasis or proteostasis at the ER, for
example ischemia, and is a common event in various human
pathologies, including the diseased heart. Cardiac integrity and
function depend on the active secretion of mature proteins from
a variety of cell types in the heart, a process that requires an
intact ER environment for efficient protein folding and
trafficking to the secretory pathway. As a consequence of ER
stress, most protein secretion by the ER secretory pathway is
decreased. Strikingly, there is a select group of proteins that
are secreted in greater quantities during ER stress. ER stress
resulting from the dysregulation of ER Ca2+ levels, for
instance, stimulates the secretion of Ca2+-binding ER
chaperones, especially GRP78, GRP94, calreticulin, and
mesencephalic astrocyte-derived neurotrophic factor (MANF),
which play a multitude of roles outside the cell, strongly
depending on the cell type and tissue. Here we review current
insights in ER stress-induced secretion of proteins,
particularly from the heart, and highlight the extracellular
functions of these proteins, ranging from the augmentation of
cardiac cell viability to the modulation of pro- and
anti-apoptotic, oncogenic, and immune-stimulatory cell
signaling, cell invasion, extracellular proteostasis, and more.
Many of the roles of ER stress-induced protein secretion remain
to be explored in the heart. This article is part of a special
issue entitled ``The Role of Proteostasis Derailment in Cardiac
Diseases.''},
