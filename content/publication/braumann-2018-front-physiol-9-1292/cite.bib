 abstract = {Background: S100A4 has recently emerged as an important player in
cardiac disease, affecting phenotype development in animal models
of myocardial infarction and pathological cardiac hypertrophy,
albeit it is unclear whether S100A4 exerts a detrimental or
beneficial function. The goal of the current study was to analyze
S100A4 expression in models of cardiac pathology, investigate its
degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS), and
furthermore examine the functional effects of S100A4 levels in a
3D model of engineered heart tissue (EHT). Methods and Results:
S100A4 mRNA and protein levels were analyzed in different models
of cardiac pathology via quantitative RT-PCR and Western blot,
showing a higher S100A4 steady-state protein concentration in
hearts of Mybpc3-knock-in (KI) hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM)
mice. COS-7 cells co-transfected with plasmids encoding mutant
(MUT) Asb2$β$ lacking the E3 ligase activity in combination
with V5-tagged S100A4 plasmid presented higher S100A4-V5 protein
steady-state concentrations than cells co-transfected with the
Asb2$β$ wild type (WT) plasmid. This effect was blunted by
treatment with the specific proteasome inhibitor epoxomicin.
Adeno-associated virus serotype 6 (AAV6)-mediated S100A4
overexpression in a 3D model of EHT did not affect contractile
parameters. Immunofluorescence analysis showed a cytosolic and
partly nuclear expression pattern of S100A4. Gene expression
analysis in EHTs overexpressing S100A4-V5 showed markedly lower
steady-state concentrations of genes involved in cardiac fibrosis
and pathological cardiac hypertrophy. Conclusion: We showed that
S100A4 protein level is higher in cardiac tissue of Mybpc3-KI HCM
mice probably as a result of a lower degradation by the E3 ligase
Asb2$β$. While an overexpression of S100A4 did not alter
contractile parameters in EHTs, downstream gene expression
analysis points toward modulation of signaling cascades involved
in fibrosis and hypertrophy.},
