 abstract = {The effects of ER stress on protein secretion by cardiac
myocytes are not well understood. In this study, the ER stressor
thapsigargin (TG), which depletes ER calcium, induced death of
cultured neonatal rat ventricular myocytes (NRVMs) in high media
volume but fostered protection in low media volume. In contrast,
another ER stressor, tunicamycin (TM), a protein glycosylation
inhibitor, induced NRVM death in all media volumes, suggesting
that protective proteins were secreted in response to TG but not
TM. Proteomic analyses of TG- and TM-conditioned media showed
that the secretion of most proteins was inhibited by TG and TM;
however, secretion of several ER-resident proteins, including
GRP78 was increased by TG but not TM. Simulated ischemia, which
decreases ER/SR calcium also increased secretion of these
proteins. Mechanistically, secreted GRP78 was shown to enhance
survival of NRVMs by collaborating with a cell-surface protein,
CRIPTO, to activate protective AKT signaling and to inhibit
death-promoting SMAD2 signaling. Thus, proteins secreted during
ER stress mediated by ER calcium depletion can enhance cardiac
myocyte viability.},
