 abstract = {Diabetes is a multi-organ disease and diabetic cardiomyopathy
can result in heart failure, which is a leading cause of
morbidity and mortality in diabetic patients. In the liver,
insulin resistance contributes to hyperglycaemia and
hyperlipidaemia, which further worsens the metabolic profile.
Defects in mTOR signalling are believed to contribute to
metabolic dysfunctions in diabetic liver and hearts, but
evidence is missing that mTOR activation is causal to the
development of diabetic cardiomyopathy. This study shows that
specific mTORC1 inhibition by PRAS40 prevents the development of
diabetic cardiomyopathy. This phenotype was associated with
improved metabolic function, blunted hypertrophic growth and
preserved cardiac function. In addition PRAS40 treatment
improves hepatic insulin sensitivity and reduces systemic
hyperglycaemia in obese mice. Thus, unlike rapamycin, mTORC1
inhibition with PRAS40 improves metabolic profile in diabetic
mice. These findings may open novel avenues for therapeutic
strategies using PRAS40 directed against diabetic-related
diseases.},
