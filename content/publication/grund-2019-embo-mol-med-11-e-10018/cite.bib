 abstract = {Pathological cardiac overload induces myocardial protein
synthesis and hypertrophy, which predisposes to heart failure.
To inhibit hypertrophy therapeutically, the identification of
negative regulators of cardiomyocyte protein synthesis is
needed. Here, we identified the tumor suppressor protein TIP30
as novel inhibitor of cardiac hypertrophy and dysfunction.
Reduced TIP30 levels in mice entailed exaggerated cardiac growth
during experimental pressure overload, which was associated with
cardiomyocyte cellular hypertrophy, increased myocardial protein
synthesis, reduced capillary density, and left ventricular
dysfunction. Pharmacological inhibition of protein synthesis
improved these defects. Our results are relevant for human
disease, since we found diminished cardiac TIP30 levels in
samples from patients suffering from end-stage heart failure or
hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Importantly, therapeutic
overexpression of TIP30 in mouse hearts inhibited cardiac
hypertrophy and improved left ventricular function during
pressure overload and in cardiomyopathic mdx mice.
Mechanistically, we identified a previously unknown
anti-hypertrophic mechanism, whereby TIP30 binds the eukaryotic
elongation factor 1A (eEF1A) to prevent the interaction with its
essential co-factor eEF1B2 and translational elongation.
Therefore, TIP30 could be a therapeutic target to counteract
cardiac hypertrophy.},
