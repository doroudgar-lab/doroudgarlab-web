 abstract = {BACKGROUND: Junctophilin-2 (JPH2) is the primary structural
protein for the coupling of transverse (T)-tubule associated
cardiac L-type Ca channels and type-2 ryanodine receptors on the
sarcoplasmic reticulum within junctional membrane complexes
(JMCs) in cardiomyocytes. Effective signaling between these
channels ensures adequate Ca-induced Ca release required for
normal cardiac contractility. Disruption of JMC subcellular
domains, a common feature of failing hearts, has been attributed
to JPH2 downregulation. Here, we tested the hypothesis that
adeno-associated virus type 9 (AAV9) mediated overexpression of
JPH2 could halt the development of heart failure in a mouse model
of transverse aortic constriction (TAC). METHODS AND RESULTS:
Following TAC, a progressive decrease in ejection fraction was
paralleled by a progressive decrease of cardiac JPH2 levels.
AAV9-mediated expression of JPH2 rescued cardiac contractility in
mice subjected to TAC. AAV9-JPH2 also preserved T-tubule
structure. Moreover, the Ca2+ spark frequency was reduced and the
Ca2+ transient amplitude was increased in AAV9-JPH2 mice
following TAC, consistent with JPH2-mediated normalization of SR
Ca2+ handling. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that
AAV9-mediated JPH2 gene therapy maintained cardiac function in
mice with early stage heart failure. Moreover, restoration of
JPH2 levels prevented loss of T-tubules and suppressed abnormal
SR Ca2+ leak associated with contractile failure following TAC.
These findings suggest that targeting JPH2 might be an attractive
therapeutic approach for treating pathological cardiac remodeling
during heart failure.},
