abstract: Pathological cardiac overload induces myocardial protein synthesis and hypertrophy,
  which predisposes to heart failure. To inhibit hypertrophy therapeutically, the
  identification of negative regulators of cardiomyocyte protein synthesis is needed.
  Here, we identified the tumor suppressor protein TIP30 as novel inhibitor of cardiac
  hypertrophy and dysfunction. Reduced TIP30 levels in mice entailed exaggerated cardiac
  growth during experimental pressure overload, which was associated with cardiomyocyte
  cellular hypertrophy, increased myocardial protein synthesis, reduced capillary
  density, and left ventricular dysfunction. Pharmacological inhibition of protein
  synthesis improved these defects. Our results are relevant for human disease, since
  we found diminished cardiac TIP30 levels in samples from patients suffering from
  end-stage heart failure or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Importantly, therapeutic
  overexpression of TIP30 in mouse hearts inhibited cardiac hypertrophy and improved
  left ventricular function during pressure overload and in cardiomyopathic mdx mice.
  Mechanistically, we identified a previously unknown anti-hypertrophic mechanism,
  whereby TIP30 binds the eukaryotic elongation factor 1A (eEF1A) to prevent the interaction
  with its essential co-factor eEF1B2 and translational elongation. Therefore, TIP30
  could be a therapeutic target to counteract cardiac hypertrophy.
