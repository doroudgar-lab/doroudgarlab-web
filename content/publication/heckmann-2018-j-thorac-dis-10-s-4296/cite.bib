 abstract = {Multiple myeloma is a malignant disease, caused by an
uncontrolled clonal proliferation of a specific group of white
blood cells, the plasma cells. Clinical manifestations include
bone pain due to osteolysis, hypercalcemia, anemia, and renal
insufficiency. Proteasome inhibitors have substantially improved
survival of patients suffering from multiple myeloma, providing
an efficient treatment option mainly for relapsed and refractory
multiple myeloma. Although constituting one substance class,
bortezomib, carfilzomib, and ixazomib differ greatly regarding
their non-hematologic side effects. This article reviews the
clinical and preclinical data on approved proteasome inhibitors
in an attempt to decipher the underlying pathomechanisms related
to cardiovascular adverse events seen in clinical trials.},
