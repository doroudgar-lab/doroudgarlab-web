abstract: RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) control critical aspects of cardiomyocyte function,
  but the repertoire of active RBPs in cardiomyocytes during the growth response is
  largely unknown. We define RBPs in healthy and diseased cardiomyocytes at a system-wide
  level by RNA interactome capture. This identifies 67 cardiomyocyte-specific RBPs,
  including several contractile proteins. Furthermore, we identify the cytoplasmic
  polyadenylation element-binding protein 4 (Cpeb4) as a dynamic RBP, regulating cardiac
  growth both in vitro and in vivo. We identify mRNAs bound to and regulated by Cpeb4
  in cardiomyocytes. Cpeb4 regulates cardiac remodeling by differential expression
  of transcription factors. Among Cpeb4 target mRNAs, two zinc finger transcription
  factors (Zeb1 and Zbtb20) are discovered. We show that Cpeb4 regulates the expression
  of these mRNAs and that Cpeb4 depletion increases their expression. Thus, Cpeb4
  emerges as a critical regulator of cardiomyocyte function by differential binding
  to specific mRNAs in response to pathological growth stimulation.
