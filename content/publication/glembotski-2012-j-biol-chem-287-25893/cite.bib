 abstract = {The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress protein mesencephalic
astrocyte-derived neurotrophic factor (MANF) has been reported
to protect cells from stress-induced cell death before and after
its secretion; however, the conditions under which it is
secreted are not known. Accordingly, we examined the mechanism
of MANF release from cultured ventricular myocytes and HeLa
cells, both of which secrete proteins via the constitutive
pathway. Although the secretion of proteins via the constitutive
pathway is not known to increase upon changes in intracellular
calcium, MANF secretion was increased within 30 min of treating
cells with compounds that deplete sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR)/ER
calcium. In contrast, secretion of atrial natriuretic factor
from ventricular myocytes was not increased by SR/ER calcium
depletion, suggesting that not all secreted proteins exhibit the
same characteristics as MANF. We postulated that SR/ER calcium
depletion triggered MANF secretion by decreasing its retention.
Consistent with this were co-immunoprecipitation and live cell,
zero distance, photo affinity cross-linking, demonstrating that,
in part, MANF was retained in the SR/ER via its
calcium-dependent interaction with the SR/ER-resident protein,
GRP78 (glucose-regulated protein 78 kDa). This unusual mechanism
of regulating secretion from the constitutive secretory pathway
provides a potentially missing link in the mechanism by which
extracellular MANF protects cells from stresses that deplete
SR/ER calcium. Consistent with this was our finding that
administration of recombinant MANF to mice decreased tissue
damage in an in vivo model of myocardial infarction, a condition
during which ER calcium is known to be dysregulated, and MANF
expression is induced.},
