 abstract = {Mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), necessary
for cellular growth, is regulated by intracellular signaling
mediating inhibition of mTORC1 activation. Among mTORC1
regulatory binding partners, the role of Proline Rich AKT
Substrate of 40 kDa (PRAS40) in controlling mTORC1 activity and
cellular growth in response to pathological and physiological
stress in the heart has never been addressed. This report shows
PRAS40 is regulated by AKT in cardiomyocytes and that AKT-driven
phosphorylation relieves the inhibitory function of PRAS40.
PRAS40 overexpression in vitro blocks mTORC1 in cardiomyocytes
and decreases pathological growth. Cardiomyocyte-specific
overexpression in vivo blunts pathological remodeling after
pressure overload and preserves cardiac function. Inhibition of
mTORC1 by PRAS40 preferentially promotes protective mTORC2
signaling in chronic diseased myocardium. In contrast, strong
PRAS40 phosphorylation by AKT allows for physiological
hypertrophy both in vitro and in vivo, whereas
cardiomyocyte-specific overexpression of a PRAS40 mutant lacking
capacity for AKT-phosphorylation inhibits physiological growth
in vivo, demonstrating that AKT-mediated PRAS40 phosphorylation
is necessary for induction of physiological hypertrophy.
Therefore, PRAS40 phosphorylation acts as a molecular switch
allowing mTORC1 activation during physiological growth, opening
up unique possibilities for therapeutic regulation of the mTORC1
complex to mitigate pathologic myocardial hypertrophy by PRAS40.},
