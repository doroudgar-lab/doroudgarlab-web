abstract: 'BACKGROUND: The mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) comprises 2 structurally
  distinct multiprotein complexes, mTOR complexes 1 and 2 (mTORC1 and mTORC2). Deregulation
  of mTOR signaling occurs during and contributes to the severity of myocardial damage
  from ischemic heart disease. However, the relative roles of mTORC1 versus mTORC2
  in the pathogenesis of ischemic damage are unknown. METHODS AND RESULTS: Combined
  pharmacological and molecular approaches were used to alter the balance of mTORC1
  and mTORC2 signaling in cultured cardiac myocytes and in mouse hearts subjected
  to conditions that mimic ischemic heart disease. The importance of mTOR signaling
  in cardiac protection was demonstrated by pharmacological inhibition of both mTORC1
  and mTORC2 with Torin1, which led to increased cardiomyocyte apoptosis and tissue
  damage after myocardial infarction. Predominant mTORC1 signaling mediated by suppression
  of mTORC2 with Rictor similarly increased cardiomyocyte apoptosis and tissue damage
  after myocardial infarction. In comparison, preferentially shifting toward mTORC2
  signaling by inhibition of mTORC1 with PRAS40 led to decreased cardiomyocyte apoptosis
  and tissue damage after myocardial infarction. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest
  that selectively increasing mTORC2 while concurrently inhibiting mTORC1 signaling
  is a novel therapeutic approach for the treatment of ischemic heart disease.'
