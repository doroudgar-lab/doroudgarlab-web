Christoph Hofmann’s exciting new paper “[mTORC1 inhibition impairs activation of the unfolded protein response and induces cell death during ER stress in cardiomyocytes”](https://doi.org/10.1152/ajpheart.00682.2022) is published in the American Journal of Physiology-Heart and Circulatory Physiology! Here, we found that mTORC1 is transiently activated early in response to ER stress and is essential for the upregulation of adaptive unfolded protein response genes and cell survival. Great job, Christoph and team!
