 abstract = {We have previously demonstrated that ischemia/reperfusion (I/R)
impairs endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-based protein folding in the
heart and thereby activates an unfolded protein response sensor
and effector, activated transcription factor 6$Î±$ (ATF6).
ATF6 then induces mesencephalic astrocyte-derived neurotrophic
factor (MANF), an ER-resident protein with no known structural
homologs and unclear ER function. To determine MANF's function
in the heart in vivo, here we developed a cardiomyocyte-specific
MANF-knockdown mouse model. MANF knockdown increased cardiac
damage after I/R, which was reversed by AAV9-mediated ectopic
MANF expression. Mechanistically, MANF knockdown in cultured
neonatal rat ventricular myocytes (NRVMs) impaired protein
folding in the ER and cardiomyocyte viability during simulated
I/R. However, this was not due to MANF-mediated protection from
reactive oxygen species generated during reperfusion. Because
I/R impairs oxygen-dependent ER protein disulfide formation and
such impairment can be caused by reductive stress in the ER, we
examined the effects of the reductive ER stressor DTT. MANF
knockdown in NRVMs increased cell death from DTT-mediated
reductive ER stress, but not from nonreductive ER stresses
caused by thapsigargin-mediated ER Ca2+ depletion or
tunicamycin-mediated inhibition of ER protein glycosylation. In
vitro, recombinant MANF exhibited chaperone activity that
depended on its conserved cysteine residues. Moreover, in cells,
MANF bound to a model ER protein exhibiting improper disulfide
bond formation during reductive ER stress but did not bind to
this protein during nonreductive ER stress. We conclude that
MANF is an ER chaperone that enhances protein folding and
myocyte viability during reductive ER stress.},
