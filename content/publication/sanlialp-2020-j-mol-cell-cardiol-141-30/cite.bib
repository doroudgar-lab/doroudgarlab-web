 abstract = {Pathological cardiac hypertrophy is an independent risk for
heart failure (HF) and sudden death. Deciphering signaling
pathways regulating intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis that control
adaptive and pathological cardiac growth may enable
identification of novel therapeutic targets. The objective of
the present study is to determine the role of the store-operated
calcium entry-associated regulatory factor (Saraf), encoded by
the Tmem66 gene, on cardiac growth control in vitro and in vivo.
Saraf is a single-pass membrane protein located at the
sarco/endoplasmic reticulum and regulates intracellular calcium
homeostasis. We found that Saraf expression was upregulated in
the hypertrophied myocardium and was sufficient for cell growth
in response to neurohumoral stimulation. Increased Saraf
expression caused cell growth, which was associated with
dysregulation of calcium-dependent signaling and sarcoplasmic
reticulum calcium content. In vivo, Saraf augmented cardiac
myocyte growth in response to angiotensin II and resulted in
increased cardiac remodeling together with worsened cardiac
function. Mechanistically, Saraf activated mTORC1 (mechanistic
target of rapamycin complex 1) and increased protein synthesis,
while mTORC1 inhibition blunted Saraf-dependent cell growth. In
contrast, the hearts of Saraf knockout mice and Saraf-deficient
myocytes did not show any morphological or functional
alterations after neurohumoral stimulation, but Saraf depletion
resulted in worsened cardiac function after acute pressure
overload. SARAF knockout blunted transverse aortic constriction
cardiac myocyte hypertrophy and impaired cardiac function,
demonstrating a role for SARAF in compensatory myocyte growth.
Collectively, these results reveal a novel link between
sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium homeostasis and mTORC1 activation
that is regulated by Saraf.},
