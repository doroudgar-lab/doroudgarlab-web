abstract: Mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), necessary for cellular
  growth, is regulated by intracellular signaling mediating inhibition of mTORC1 activation.
  Among mTORC1 regulatory binding partners, the role of Proline Rich AKT Substrate
  of 40 kDa (PRAS40) in controlling mTORC1 activity and cellular growth in response
  to pathological and physiological stress in the heart has never been addressed.
  This report shows PRAS40 is regulated by AKT in cardiomyocytes and that AKT-driven
  phosphorylation relieves the inhibitory function of PRAS40. PRAS40 overexpression
  in vitro blocks mTORC1 in cardiomyocytes and decreases pathological growth. Cardiomyocyte-specific
  overexpression in vivo blunts pathological remodeling after pressure overload and
  preserves cardiac function. Inhibition of mTORC1 by PRAS40 preferentially promotes
  protective mTORC2 signaling in chronic diseased myocardium. In contrast, strong
  PRAS40 phosphorylation by AKT allows for physiological hypertrophy both in vitro
  and in vivo, whereas cardiomyocyte-specific overexpression of a PRAS40 mutant lacking
  capacity for AKT-phosphorylation inhibits physiological growth in vivo, demonstrating
  that AKT-mediated PRAS40 phosphorylation is necessary for induction of physiological
  hypertrophy. Therefore, PRAS40 phosphorylation acts as a molecular switch allowing
  mTORC1 activation during physiological growth, opening up unique possibilities for
  therapeutic regulation of the mTORC1 complex to mitigate pathologic myocardial hypertrophy
  by PRAS40.
