 abstract = {RATIONALE: Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress causes the
accumulation of misfolded proteins in the ER, activating the
transcription factor, ATF6 (activating transcription factor 6
alpha), which induces ER stress response genes. Myocardial
ischemia induces the ER stress response; however, neither the
function of this response nor whether it is mediated by ATF6 is
known. OBJECTIVE: Here, we examined the effects of blocking the
ATF6-mediated ER stress response on ischemia/reperfusion (I/R)
in cardiac myocytes and mouse hearts. METHODS AND RESULTS:
Knockdown of ATF6 in cardiac myocytes subjected to I/R increased
reactive oxygen species and necrotic cell death, both of which
were mitigated by ATF6 overexpression. Under nonstressed
conditions, wild-type and ATF6 knockout mouse hearts were
similar. However, compared with wild-type, ATF6 knockout hearts
showed increased damage and decreased function after I/R.
Mechanistically, gene array analysis showed that ATF6, which is
known to induce genes encoding ER proteins that augment ER
protein folding, induced numerous oxidative stress response
genes not previously known to be ATF6-inducible. Many of the
proteins encoded by the ATF6-induced oxidative stress genes
identified here reside outside the ER, including catalase, which
is known to decrease damaging reactive oxygen species in the
heart. Catalase was induced by the canonical ER stressor,
tunicamycin, and by I/R in cardiac myocytes from wild-type but
not in cardiac myocytes from ATF6 knockout mice. ER stress
response elements were identified in the catalase gene and were
shown to bind ATF6 in cardiac myocytes, which increased catalase
promoter activity. Overexpression of catalase, in vivo, restored
ATF6 knockout mouse heart function to wild-type levels in a
mouse model of I/R, as did adeno-associated virus 9-mediated
ATF6 overexpression. CONCLUSIONS: ATF6 serves an important role
as a previously unappreciated link between the ER stress and
oxidative stress gene programs, supporting a novel mechanism by
which ATF6 decreases myocardial I/R damage.},
