 abstract = {ER stress leads to upregulation of multiple folding and quality
control components, known as the unfolded protein response
(UPR). Glucose Regulated Protein 78 (GRP78) (also known as
binding immunoglobulin protein, BiP, and HSPA5) and GRP94 are
often upregulated coordinately as part of this homeostatic
response. Given that endoplasmic reticulum (ER) chaperones have
distinct sets of clients, we asked how cells respond to ablation
of individual chaperones. The cellular responses to silencing
BiP, GRP94, HSP47, PDIA6 and OS-9, were distinct. When BiP was
silenced, a widespread UPR was observed, but when GRP94 was
either inhibited or depleted by RNA interference (RNAi), the
expression of only some genes was induced, notably those
encoding BiP and protein disulfide isomerase A6 (PDIA6).
Silencing of HSP47 or OS-9 did not lead to any compensatory
induction of other genes. The selective response to GRP94
depletion was distinct from a typical ER stress response, both
because other UPR target genes were not affected and because the
canonical UPR signaling branches were not activated. The
response to silencing of GRP94 did not preclude further UPR
induction when chemical stress was imposed. Importantly,
re-expression of wild-type GRP94 in the silenced cells prevented
the upregulation of BiP and PDIA6, whereas re-expression of an
ATPase-deficient GRP94 mutant did not, indicating that cells
monitor the activity state of GRP94. These findings suggest that
cells are able to distinguish among folding resources and
generate distinct responses.},
