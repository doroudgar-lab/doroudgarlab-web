abstract: 'RATIONALE: Gene expression profiles have been mainly determined by analysis
  of transcript abundance. However, these analyses cannot capture posttranscriptional
  gene expression control at the level of translation, which is a key step in the
  regulation of gene expression, as evidenced by the fact that transcript levels often
  poorly correlate with protein levels. Furthermore, genome-wide transcript profiling
  of distinct cell types is challenging due to the fact that lysates from tissues
  always represent a mixture of cells. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to develop a new
  experimental method that overcomes both limitations and to apply this method to
  perform a genome-wide analysis of gene expression on the translational level in
  response to pressure overload. METHODS AND RESULTS: By combining ribosome profiling
  (Ribo-seq) with a ribosome-tagging approach (Ribo-tag), it was possible to determine
  the translated transcriptome in specific cell types from the heart. After pressure
  overload, we monitored the cardiac myocyte translatome by purifying tagged cardiac
  myocyte ribosomes from cardiac lysates and subjecting the ribosome-protected mRNA
  fragments to deep sequencing. We identified subsets of mRNAs that are regulated
  at the translational level and found that translational control determines early
  changes in gene expression in response to cardiac stress in cardiac myocytes. Translationally
  controlled transcripts are associated with specific biological processes related
  to translation, protein quality control, and metabolism. Mechanistically, Ribo-seq
  allowed for the identification of upstream open reading frames in transcripts, which
  we predict to be important regulators of translation. CONCLUSIONS: This method has
  the potential to (1) provide a new tool for studying cell-specific gene expression
  at the level of translation in tissues, (2) reveal new therapeutic targets to prevent
  cellular remodeling, and (3) trigger follow-up studies that address both, the molecular
  mechanisms involved in the posttranscriptional control of gene expression in cardiac
  cells, and the protective functions of proteins expressed in response to cellular
  stress.'
