title: "Protein Secretion"
summary: "Our studies of protein secretion began when we turned our attention to the effects of cellular stress and protein misfolding on cellular secretion of critical paracrine proteins, and discovered a unique mechanism of secretion of MANF, a novel ER stress response protein. This study led the way to our research into a more global view of proteins secreted from cardiac myocytes, wherein we examined the cardiac myocyte secretome in response to protein folding stresses."
