title: "Protein Synthesis"
summary: "Although changes in gene expression represent a fundamental feature of cardiac disease, transcript levels often poorly correlate with respective protein levels, suggesting post-transcriptional gene expression control may be disease-regulated in the heart. We developed a new experimental method to identify which transcripts are actively translated in cardiac myocytes in the diseased mouse heart, in vivo. We combined ribosome profiling with a ribosome-tagging approach that enabled us to isolate and sequence transcripts that are engaged in protein synthesis specifically from mouse cardiac myocytes in vivo; defined as the cardiac myocyte translatome. Using this cell-type–specific Ribo-seq approach, we defined the translational response of cardiac myocytes during hypertrophic stress (pressure overload). This work demonstrates the magnitude of the cellular stress response at the translational level and lays the foundation for discovery of novel molecular mechanisms across all areas of cardiovascular pathophysiology."
