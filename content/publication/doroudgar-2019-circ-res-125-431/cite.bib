 abstract = {RATIONALE: Gene expression profiles have been mainly determined
by analysis of transcript abundance. However, these analyses
cannot capture posttranscriptional gene expression control at
the level of translation, which is a key step in the regulation
of gene expression, as evidenced by the fact that transcript
levels often poorly correlate with protein levels. Furthermore,
genome-wide transcript profiling of distinct cell types is
challenging due to the fact that lysates from tissues always
represent a mixture of cells. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to
develop a new experimental method that overcomes both
limitations and to apply this method to perform a genome-wide
analysis of gene expression on the translational level in
response to pressure overload. METHODS AND RESULTS: By combining
ribosome profiling (Ribo-seq) with a ribosome-tagging approach
(Ribo-tag), it was possible to determine the translated
transcriptome in specific cell types from the heart. After
pressure overload, we monitored the cardiac myocyte translatome
by purifying tagged cardiac myocyte ribosomes from cardiac
lysates and subjecting the ribosome-protected mRNA fragments to
deep sequencing. We identified subsets of mRNAs that are
regulated at the translational level and found that
translational control determines early changes in gene
expression in response to cardiac stress in cardiac myocytes.
Translationally controlled transcripts are associated with
specific biological processes related to translation, protein
quality control, and metabolism. Mechanistically, Ribo-seq
allowed for the identification of upstream open reading frames
in transcripts, which we predict to be important regulators of
translation. CONCLUSIONS: This method has the potential to (1)
provide a new tool for studying cell-specific gene expression at
the level of translation in tissues, (2) reveal new therapeutic
targets to prevent cellular remodeling, and (3) trigger
follow-up studies that address both, the molecular mechanisms
involved in the posttranscriptional control of gene expression
in cardiac cells, and the protective functions of proteins
expressed in response to cellular stress.},
