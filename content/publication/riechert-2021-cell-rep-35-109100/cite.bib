 abstract = {RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) control critical aspects of
cardiomyocyte function, but the repertoire of active RBPs in
cardiomyocytes during the growth response is largely unknown. We
define RBPs in healthy and diseased cardiomyocytes at a
system-wide level by RNA interactome capture. This identifies 67
cardiomyocyte-specific RBPs, including several contractile
proteins. Furthermore, we identify the cytoplasmic
polyadenylation element-binding protein 4 (Cpeb4) as a dynamic
RBP, regulating cardiac growth both in vitro and in vivo. We
identify mRNAs bound to and regulated by Cpeb4 in
cardiomyocytes. Cpeb4 regulates cardiac remodeling by
differential expression of transcription factors. Among Cpeb4
target mRNAs, two zinc finger transcription factors (Zeb1 and
Zbtb20) are discovered. We show that Cpeb4 regulates the
expression of these mRNAs and that Cpeb4 depletion increases
their expression. Thus, Cpeb4 emerges as a critical regulator of
cardiomyocyte function by differential binding to specific mRNAs
in response to pathological growth stimulation.},
