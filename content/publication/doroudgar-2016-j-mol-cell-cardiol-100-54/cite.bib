 abstract = {BACKGROUND: Myocardial infarction is followed by cardiac
dysfunction, cellular death, and ventricular remodeling,
including tissue fibrosis. S100A4 protein plays multiple roles
in cellular survival, and tissue fibrosis, but the relative role
of the S100A4 in the myocardium after myocardial infarction is
unknown. This study aims to investigate the role of S100A4 in
myocardial remodeling and cardiac function following infarct
damage. METHODS AND RESULTS: S100A4 expression is low in the
adult myocardium, but significantly increased following
myocardial infarction. Deletion of S100A4 increased cardiac
damage after myocardial infarction, whereas cardiac
myocyte-specific overexpression of S100A4 protected the
infarcted myocardium. Decreased cardiac function in S100A4
Knockout mice was accompanied with increased cardiac remodeling,
fibrosis, and diminished capillary density in the remote
myocardium. Loss of S100A4 caused increased apoptotic cell death
both in vitro and in vivo in part mediated by decreased VEGF
expression. Conversely, S100A4 overexpression protected cells
against apoptosis in vitro and in vivo. Increased pro-survival
AKT-signaling explained reduced apoptosis in S100A4
overexpressing cells. CONCLUSION: S100A4 expression protects
cardiac myocytes against myocardial ischemia and is required for
stabilization of cardiac function after MI.},
