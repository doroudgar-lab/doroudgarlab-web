 abstract = {BACKGROUND: The mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) comprises
2 structurally distinct multiprotein complexes, mTOR complexes 1
and 2 (mTORC1 and mTORC2). Deregulation of mTOR signaling occurs
during and contributes to the severity of myocardial damage from
ischemic heart disease. However, the relative roles of mTORC1
versus mTORC2 in the pathogenesis of ischemic damage are
unknown. METHODS AND RESULTS: Combined pharmacological and
molecular approaches were used to alter the balance of mTORC1
and mTORC2 signaling in cultured cardiac myocytes and in mouse
hearts subjected to conditions that mimic ischemic heart
disease. The importance of mTOR signaling in cardiac protection
was demonstrated by pharmacological inhibition of both mTORC1
and mTORC2 with Torin1, which led to increased cardiomyocyte
apoptosis and tissue damage after myocardial infarction.
Predominant mTORC1 signaling mediated by suppression of mTORC2
with Rictor similarly increased cardiomyocyte apoptosis and
tissue damage after myocardial infarction. In comparison,
preferentially shifting toward mTORC2 signaling by inhibition of
mTORC1 with PRAS40 led to decreased cardiomyocyte apoptosis and
tissue damage after myocardial infarction. CONCLUSIONS: These
results suggest that selectively increasing mTORC2 while
concurrently inhibiting mTORC1 signaling is a novel therapeutic
approach for the treatment of ischemic heart disease.},
