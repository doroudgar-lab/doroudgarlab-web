 abstract = {RATIONALE: Hydroxymethyl glutaryl-coenzyme A reductase
degradation protein 1 (Hrd1) is an endoplasmic reticulum
(ER)-transmembrane E3 ubiquitin ligase that has been studied in
yeast, where it contributes to ER protein quality control by
ER-associated degradation (ERAD) of misfolded proteins that
accumulate during ER stress. Neither Hrd1 nor ERAD has been
studied in the heart, or in cardiac myocytes, where protein
quality control is critical for proper heart function.
OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study were to elucidate roles
for Hrd1 in ER stress, ERAD, and viability in cultured cardiac
myocytes and in the mouse heart, in vivo. METHODS AND RESULTS:
The effects of small interfering RNA-mediated Hrd1 knockdown
were examined in cultured neonatal rat ventricular myocytes. The
effects of adeno-associated virus-mediated Hrd1 knockdown and
overexpression were examined in the hearts of mice subjected to
pressure overload-induced pathological cardiac hypertrophy,
which challenges protein-folding capacity. In cardiac myocytes,
the ER stressors, thapsigargin and tunicamycin increased ERAD,
as well as adaptive ER stress proteins, and minimally affected
cell death. However, when Hrd1 was knocked down, thapsigargin
and tunicamycin dramatically decreased ERAD, while increasing
maladaptive ER stress proteins and cell death. In vivo, Hrd1
knockdown exacerbated cardiac dysfunction and increased
apoptosis and cardiac hypertrophy, whereas Hrd1 overexpression
preserved cardiac function and decreased apoptosis and
attenuated cardiac hypertrophy in the hearts of mice subjected
to pressure overload. CONCLUSIONS: Hrd1 and ERAD are essential
components of the adaptive ER stress response in cardiac
myocytes. Hrd1 contributes to preserving heart structure and
function in a mouse model of pathological cardiac hypertrophy.},
